[b]Chaos Terraria[/b] is a challenge mod which causes random events to happen at set intervals (10 seconds by default).

The mod is highly configurable, allowing the user to specify the relative weights of each event. There are some additional events added while Calamity Mod is enabled.

It is inspired by Chaos Mario 64. I plan to potentially add more event and adjust the existing ones.

There are some Calamity Mod exclusive events.

[h2]How to Configure[/h2]
Using the ingame mod configuration, the weights of various events can be changed. Setting an event to a weight of 0 will effectively disable it.
All the weights are relative to the other values. When an event is rolled, a random number is chosen that is less than the sum of all event weights. Essentially this means that the chance of a given event is equal to the [weight / sum of weights].
Basically, a larger weight means an event is more common, smaller weights mean an event is less common.
